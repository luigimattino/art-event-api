## API
### 1. Live events

The format is `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ`, where `T` separates the date and time components and `Z` indicates that the time is in UTC. The `.sss` portion is optional, and is used to represent milliseconds. These fields can be easily parsed and used to perform calculations or comparisons with other dates.
